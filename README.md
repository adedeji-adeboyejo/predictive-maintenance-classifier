# predictive-maintenance-classifier

A machine learning project built for as part of a Data Analysis coursework, taking on the role of a Business Analyst assigned to the maintenance team of a large manufacturing organisation. The goal is to predict machine failure types using historical sensor and operational data, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and reducing unplanned downtime.


### Project Brief
"As a business analyst assigned to a maintenance team of a large manufacturing organization, assist in predicting common failures. The maintenance team has provided a historical dataset that contains characteristics tied to a given failure type and would like you to predict which failure will occur in the future."

The failure types include:
- No Failure (Machine is operating normally)
- Overstrain (Mechanical overload due to excessive torque or speed)
- Power Failures (Electrical/power-related failure)
- 
Model Type: 3+ category prediction (multi-class classification)

# 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 9,928 records of machine operational readings, each labelled with a failure outcome.
